          <h2>Bio</h2>
          <p>
            I am a graduate of Lambda School's web development track with a background in computer science and a
            lifelong learner mentality. At Lambda School I had the choice for back-end to take Node.js or Java Spring.
            Since Java was my first programming language when I was taking computer science classes at South Seattle
            College and Western Washington University I jumped at the opportunity to take the Java track. That rekindled
            my adoration for the language and sparked my desire to write more meaningful and maintainable code.<br />
            <br />
            I am passionate about the tech industry because I believe it is the most exciting industry of our time and I
            sincerely enjoy helping to build something bigger than what I can build on my own. I love the thrill of
            completing a task, a sprint in a larger project, and ‘naturally’ entire projects. I also greatly enjoy the
            feeling of gaining familiarity with new concepts that often seem overwhelmingly complex when I start to
            learn them.<br />
            <br />
            Outside of tech I briefly attended a culinary school in New York, worked at Macy’s for several years mostly
            in the cash office and gift wrap departments as well as on the sales floor. I have worked in several
            different kitchen roles and had a few customer centric office jobs.

          <p>Takes user preferences and generates a list of relevant cities based on criteria such as weather,
            crime rate and location. Using Spring boot collaboratively created a RDBMS to store user data pulled
            in from the react front-end.
            Collaborated remotely with 5 other web Developers and 5 data science engineers to build a fully
            functional application for our stake holder.
